# Daily Treasury Statements

Every business day the US Treasury Department publishes a report on the cash and debt operations of the United States Treasury.  What's neat (to me) about this is that it tells you how much revenue the government is taking in from income tax withholding.  There's likely a lot more cool stuff in this data so I wanted to make the scraper/parser public.

Special thanks to [Joel Wertheimer](https://twitter.com/wertwhile) for telling me about this data set.

[Here's an example statement](https://www.fms.treas.gov/fmsweb/viewDTSFiles?dir=a&fname=18010200.txt).

The section I'm interested in is Table IV, which looks like this:

## Scraping

See `txt-files/scrape.sh`.  It uses curl and just downloads every date it can.  The "archive" (which are before a certain date) DTSs are scraped separately because the URL is slightly different.  I have included by scraped files in this checkout.

```
d=2010-01-01
while [ "$d" != 2017-09-30 ]; do
    fn=$(gdate -d $d +%y%m%d)"00.txt";
    url="https://www.fms.treas.gov/fmsweb/viewDTSFiles?dir=a&fname="$fn;
    if [ ! -f "$fn" ]; then
	curl $url -o $fn;
	sleep 3;
    fi
d=$(gdate -I -d "$d + 1 day");
done
```

## Parsing

See `parse.py`.  It's a really simple line-based parser but works becuase the format is pretty consistent.

## Data

See `data/treasury_income.csv`.  The data are (mostly) tidy:

- ds: date of the statement
- mtd: month to date tally of the revenue
- rev: revenue on that day
- type: type of revenue (I map the descriptions to rough categories)
- ytd: (fiscal) year-to-date tally of the revenue

## EDA

See `EDA.ipynb`.  Not much there yet! Feel free to fork and have fun.
